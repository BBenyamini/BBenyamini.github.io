<div style="text-align: justify"> I am a research and data analysis professional with experience in working with Non-governmental organizations, 
  academic institutions, and private companies. I conduct field surveys, analyze data, and communicate results to diverse audiences.
  In the past few years I have gained skills and experience in developing simple models to describe complex phenomena. 
  I use methods that range from A/B tests to machine learning, to test hypotheses and draw reliable conclusions. </div>
